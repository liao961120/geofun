# geofun

This is a personal package created to facilitate my learning in Cartography and GIS. 

I think it's a cool idea to create a package while taking a course, since you can write & document functions at the same time, and can even use package vignettes as a method to take notes.

## Installation

``` r
install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('geofun')
```
